Here you can find the source code for my CV which is hosted on [Joshua Menke.de](https://joshuamenke.de).

It was build with [Vue.JS](https://vuejs.org/) and some helpers from the CSS framework [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com)

This should highlight my current experience in web development with JavaScript, VueJS, CSS and more.


While building the code for production works right now:

Just pull this repository and run  
```bash
cd joshuamenke.de
npm install
npm run build
```

Live coding with Hot Reload is currently under maintenance until all dependency problems have been resolved.
